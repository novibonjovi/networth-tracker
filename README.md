##  Project

My goal for this project was to build a website with different graphs to display the networth and different financial accounts by adding the amount for each month to the local storage of the browser.
By clicking on the the accounts on the left sidebar a prompt shows up and lets you enter the month (as a number from 1-12) and next the amount for that month.
